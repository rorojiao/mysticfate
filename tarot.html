const TAROT_DECK = [
  // Major Arcana
  {name:"The Fool",symbol:"🃏",upright:"New beginnings, spontaneity, a free spirit. The Fool steps off the cliff edge not out of ignorance, but out of radical trust. This card whispers that the universe catches those brave enough to leap. Something entirely new is calling you — a chapter that can't begin until you release your grip on the familiar.",reversed:"Recklessness, fear of the unknown, holding back. The Fool reversed suggests you're either leaping without looking or refusing to leap at all. There's a hesitation born of past wounds, or perhaps a naïve rush that ignores real consequences. Pause — but don't freeze."},
  {name:"The Magician",symbol:"🎭",upright:"Manifestation, resourcefulness, power of will. The Magician reminds you that every tool you need is already on the table before you. Channel, focus, create. You are the conduit between intention and reality — stop waiting for permission and start channeling your gifts.",reversed:"Manipulation, poor planning, untapped talents. Reversed, the Magician warns of illusions — either ones you're creating for others or ones you've fallen for yourself. Your potential is immense but scattered. Ground yourself before you try to conjure anything."},
  {name:"The High Priestess",symbol:"🌙",upright:"Intuition, sacred knowledge, the subconscious mind. She sits at the threshold between the seen and unseen, guarding mysteries that logic cannot reach. Trust what you feel beneath the surface. The answers you seek won't come from research — they'll come from stillness.",reversed:"Secrets, disconnected from intuition, withdrawal. The High Priestess reversed suggests you've been ignoring your inner voice or that someone is withholding important information. Reconnect with your deeper knowing — the noise of the world has drowned it out."},
  {name:"The Empress",symbol:"👑",upright:"Abundance, nurturing, fertility, sensual pleasure. The Empress is the garden in full bloom — she represents creative expression, material comfort, and the deep satisfaction of bringing something beautiful into being. Nourish what you love and watch it flourish.",reversed:"Creative block, dependence, emptiness. Reversed, the Empress signals neglect — of yourself, your body, or your creative spark. You may be giving too much to others and keeping nothing for yourself, or smothering someone with attention they didn't ask for."},
  {name:"The Emperor",symbol:"🏛️",upright:"Authority, structure, a father figure, solid foundation. The Emperor builds empires through discipline and clear vision. This card calls you to take command of your situation — establish order, set boundaries, and lead with both strength and wisdom.",reversed:"Domination, excessive control, rigidity. The Emperor reversed warns of tyranny — perhaps your own. Control has tipped into oppression, whether you're wielding it or suffering under it. Flexibility isn't weakness; it's the difference between a pillar and a prison."},
  {name:"The Hierophant",symbol:"⛪",upright:"Spiritual wisdom, religious beliefs, tradition, conformity. The Hierophant represents established institutions, mentorship, and the wisdom passed down through lineage. Sometimes the old ways hold profound truth. Seek guidance from those who've walked this path before.",reversed:"Personal beliefs, freedom, challenging the status quo. Reversed, the Hierophant urges you to question inherited dogma. The traditions that once served you may now confine you. Your spiritual authority lives within — stop outsourcing your truth."},
  {name:"The Lovers",symbol:"❤️",upright:"Love, harmony, relationships, values alignment, choices. The Lovers transcend romance — this card speaks to any profound union or choice that defines who you become. A decision stands before you that requires you to align head and heart as one.",reversed:"Self-love, disharmony, imbalance, misalignment. Reversed, the Lovers suggest an inner conflict — your values and actions are at war. A relationship may be out of balance, or you're avoiding a choice that demands honesty about what you truly want."},
  {name:"The Chariot",symbol:"⚔️",upright:"Willpower, determination, triumph through inner strength. The Chariot charges forward, pulled by opposing forces held together through sheer will. Victory is yours — but only if you can harness your conflicting desires into one focused direction.",reversed:"Self-doubt, lack of direction, aggression. The Chariot reversed means the reins have slipped. You're either forcing your way through obstacles that require finesse, or you've lost your sense of direction entirely. Regroup before you charge ahead."},
  {name:"Strength",symbol:"🦁",upright:"Inner strength, bravery, compassion, quiet influence. This isn't brute force — it's the gentle hand that tames the lion. Your greatest power right now comes from patience, kindness, and the quiet courage to face what frightens you without flinching.",reversed:"Self-doubt, weakness, insecurity, raw emotion. Reversed, Strength warns that fear is winning. You may be doubting your own resilience or letting anxiety dictate your choices. The lion inside you hasn't disappeared — you've just stopped trusting it."},
  {name:"The Hermit",symbol:"🏔️",upright:"Soul-searching, introspection, solitude, inner guidance. The Hermit climbs the mountain alone, carrying a lantern that illuminates only the next step. This is your season of withdrawal — not from weakness, but from wisdom. The answers you need exist in silence.",reversed:"Isolation, loneliness, withdrawal. The Hermit reversed suggests solitude has curdled into loneliness. You've been alone too long, or you're avoiding necessary reflection by staying constantly busy. Find the balance between healthy solitude and self-imposed exile."},
  {name:"Wheel of Fortune",symbol:"🎡",upright:"Good luck, karma, life cycles, destiny, a turning point. The Wheel reminds you that nothing — neither fortune nor misfortune — lasts forever. A great shift is underway. Embrace the movement; resistance only guarantees you'll be dragged rather than carried.",reversed:"Bad luck, resistance to change, breaking cycles. Reversed, the Wheel suggests you're fighting against a natural transition or trapped in a karmic loop. The universe is trying to move you forward, but you keep reaching for what's behind you."},
  {name:"Justice",symbol:"⚖️",upright:"Fairness, truth, cause and effect, accountability. Justice holds her sword and scales with unwavering precision. The truth will surface, consequences will arrive, and balance will be restored. If you've acted with integrity, you have nothing to fear.",reversed:"Unfairness, lack of accountability, dishonesty. Justice reversed warns that something is out of balance — a situation is unjust, someone is avoiding accountability, or you're not being honest with yourself about your role in a conflict."},
  {name:"The Hanged Man",symbol:"🙃",upright:"Surrender, letting go, new perspectives, sacrifice. The Hanged Man doesn't struggle — he hangs by choice, seeing the world from an angle no one else considers. Release your grip on how things 'should' be. In surrender, enlightenment waits.",reversed:"Delays, resistance, stalling, needless sacrifice. Reversed, the Hanged Man suggests you're either martyring yourself unnecessarily or stubbornly refusing to see another perspective. Something needs to be released, but you're white-knuckling it instead."},
  {name:"Death",symbol:"💀",upright:"Endings, change, transformation, transition. Death is not destruction — it is the composting of what was into the soil of what will be. Something in your life is ending so profoundly that you will not be the same person on the other side. Let it die with grace.",reversed:"Resistance to change, personal transformation delayed, stagnation. Death reversed means you're clinging to something that has already expired. The transformation is happening whether you cooperate or not — resistance only extends the pain."},
  {name:"Temperance",symbol:"⚗️",upright:"Balance, moderation, patience, finding meaning. Temperance pours water between two cups in an endless, meditative flow. This card calls for the middle path — not lukewarm compromise, but the artful blending of opposites into something greater than either alone.",reversed:"Imbalance, excess, self-healing, realignment. Reversed, Temperance signals that something has tipped too far in one direction. You've been overindulging, overworking, or over-giving. The recipe is off — adjust before you burn the whole thing."},
  {name:"The Devil",symbol:"😈",upright:"Shadow self, attachment, addiction, restriction, sexuality. The Devil reveals the chains you've placed on yourself — the habits, relationships, and beliefs that imprison you while you pretend they don't. The chains are loose enough to lift over your head. Will you?",reversed:"Releasing limiting beliefs, exploring dark thoughts, detachment. The Devil reversed is a liberation card — you're breaking free from what bound you, seeing clearly through illusions that once controlled you. The shadow, once faced, loses its power."},
  {name:"The Tower",symbol:"🗼",upright:"Sudden change, upheaval, chaos, revelation, awakening. Lightning strikes the Tower, and everything built on false foundations crumbles. This isn't punishment — it's liberation disguised as destruction. What falls apart now was never going to hold. Trust the demolition.",reversed:"Personal transformation, fear of change, averting disaster. The Tower reversed suggests the upheaval is internal rather than external. You may be on the edge of a breakdown — or a breakthrough. Sometimes the Tower falls in slow motion, giving you time to step out before it collapses."},
  {name:"The Star",symbol:"⭐",upright:"Hope, faith, purpose, renewal, serenity. After the Tower's destruction, the Star appears — naked, vulnerable, and luminous. This is the calm after the storm, the quiet knowing that everything will be okay. Pour your heart into healing; the universe is watching over you.",reversed:"Lack of faith, despair, self-trust, disconnection. The Star reversed means you've lost sight of hope. The light hasn't gone out — you've just stopped looking up. This is temporary darkness, not permanent absence. Reconnect with what once inspired you."},
  {name:"The Moon",symbol:"🌕",upright:"Illusion, fear, anxiety, subconscious, intuition. The Moon illuminates a landscape of shadows where nothing is quite what it seems. Trust your instincts over your eyes right now. Confusion and anxiety are part of the journey — the path through uncertainty requires you to feel your way forward.",reversed:"Release of fear, repressed emotion, inner confusion. The Moon reversed brings clarity after confusion — the fog is lifting, and what once seemed terrifying reveals itself as manageable. Repressed emotions may surface now, demanding to be felt."},
  {name:"The Sun",symbol:"☀️",upright:"Positivity, fun, warmth, success, vitality. The Sun blazes with uncomplicated joy — this is the card of yes. Whatever you're hoping for, whatever you've been working toward, the light is shining directly on it. Success, happiness, and radiant energy surround you.",reversed:"Inner child, feeling down, overly optimistic. The Sun reversed hasn't lost its warmth, but clouds obscure it temporarily. You may be struggling to see the bright side, or you're wearing optimism as a mask over real pain. Let yourself feel both the shadow and the light."},
  {name:"Judgement",symbol:"📯",upright:"Judgement, rebirth, inner calling, absolution. The trumpet sounds, and the dead rise — not to be condemned, but to be reborn. This is your moment of reckoning and renewal. Answer the call that's been growing louder inside you. Forgive yourself, and rise.",reversed:"Self-doubt, inner critic, ignoring the call. Judgement reversed means you're either judging yourself too harshly or refusing to hear a call that demands your attention. The resurrection can't happen if you insist on staying in the tomb."},
  {name:"The World",symbol:"🌍",upright:"Completion, integration, accomplishment, travel. The World card is the final exhale — the dance of completion, the integration of every lesson learned through the entire journey. A major cycle is complete. You've arrived. Celebrate before the next spiral begins.",reversed:"Seeking personal closure, short-cuts, delays. The World reversed suggests you're almost there but not quite. A final piece is missing — a lesson unlearned, a conversation unfinished, a fear unfaced. Complete what remains before you claim the prize."},
  // Wands
  {name:"Ace of Wands",symbol:"🔥",upright:"Inspiration, new opportunities, growth, potential. A spark of pure creative fire has been placed in your hands. This is the seed of something passionate and alive — a project, a calling, a desire that demands to be pursued. Act on it before it cools.",reversed:"An emerging idea not yet fully formed, lack of direction, delays, distractions from creative goals."},
  {name:"Two of Wands",symbol:"🔥",upright:"Future planning, progress, decisions, discovery. You stand at the edge of the known world, globe in hand, contemplating your next great adventure. The groundwork is laid; now choose your direction with courage and vision.",reversed:"Fear of the unknown, lack of planning, playing it too safe when boldness is required."},
  {name:"Three of Wands",symbol:"🔥",upright:"Progress, expansion, foresight, overseas opportunities. Your ships are on the horizon — the investments of energy you've made are beginning to return. Expand your vision; think bigger than your current borders allow.",reversed:"Playing small, lack of foresight, delays in plans coming to fruition, unexpected obstacles."},
  {name:"Four of Wands",symbol:"🔥",upright:"Celebration, joy, harmony, relaxation, homecoming. The Four of Wands is a harvest festival — a moment to pause and celebrate what you've built. Community, stability, and joyful milestones surround you.",reversed:"Personal celebration, inner harmony, conflict with community, transition, feeling unwelcome."},
  {name:"Five of Wands",symbol:"🔥",upright:"Conflict, disagreements, competition, tension. Five figures clash their wands in chaotic combat — but look closely: no one is wounded. This is creative friction, healthy competition, or the messy process of working out differences. Lean into the conflict; resolution lives on the other side.",reversed:"Inner conflict, conflict avoidance, tension release, finding common ground."},
  {name:"Six of Wands",symbol:"🔥",upright:"Success, public recognition, progress, self-confidence. The crowd cheers as you ride through with your laurel wreath held high. This is your victory lap — own it fully. Your efforts have been seen and celebrated.",reversed:"Private achievement, fall from grace, self-doubt despite success, egotism."},
  {name:"Seven of Wands",symbol:"🔥",upright:"Challenge, competition, protection, perseverance. You stand on higher ground, defending your position against those who want to take it. The advantage is yours, but you must fight to keep it. Don't back down now — you've earned this hill.",reversed:"Exhaustion, giving up, overwhelmed by competition, self-doubt about your position."},
  {name:"Eight of Wands",symbol:"🔥",upright:"Speed, action, air travel, movement, swift change. Eight wands fly through the air with unstoppable momentum. Things are about to accelerate dramatically. Messages arrive, travel beckons, and delays evaporate. Hold on — the pace is about to pick up.",reversed:"Delays, frustration, resisting change, internal alignment needed before action."},
  {name:"Nine of Wands",symbol:"🔥",upright:"Resilience, courage, persistence, test of faith, boundaries. Battered but unbroken, the figure leans on their wand with eight more standing guard behind them. You've been through so much — but you're still here. One final push is needed. Don't quit on the last mile.",reversed:"Inner resources, struggle, overwhelm, defensive, paranoia, on the verge of giving up."},
  {name:"Ten of Wands",symbol:"🔥",upright:"Burden, extra responsibility, hard work, completion. You're carrying ten wands and can barely see where you're going. The weight is real, but the destination is close. Consider what you can delegate or release — not everything on your back belongs to you.",reversed:"Doing it all, carrying too much, delegation, release, burnout, inability to set boundaries."},
  {name:"Page of Wands",symbol:"🔥",upright:"Inspiration, ideas, discovery, limitless potential, free spirit. The Page of Wands is a dreamer with a fire in their belly — full of ideas, curiosity, and the infectious enthusiasm of someone who hasn't yet learned to be cynical. Follow that spark.",reversed:"Newly formed ideas, redirecting energy, self-limiting beliefs, a creative spark waiting to be nurtured."},
  {name:"Knight of Wands",symbol:"🔥",upright:"Energy, passion, inspired action, adventure, impulsiveness. The Knight charges forward with absolute confidence and zero hesitation. This is the energy of bold action, passionate pursuit, and saying yes before you've thought it through. Harness the fire — but don't burn the map.",reversed:"Passion project stalled, haste, scattered energy, delays in travel, frustration with pace."},
  {name:"Queen of Wands",symbol:"🔥",upright:"Courage, confidence, independence, social butterfly, determination. The Queen of Wands commands every room she enters — not through dominance, but through radiant, magnetic presence. She knows who she is and makes no apologies. Channel her energy: be bold, be warm, be unapologetically yourself.",reversed:"Self-respect, self-confidence rebuilding, introverted, re-establishing personal power."},
  {name:"King of Wands",symbol:"🔥",upright:"Natural-born leader, vision, entrepreneur, honor. The King of Wands leads with charisma, vision, and an unshakable sense of purpose. He inspires others not through fear but through the sheer force of his conviction. Step into your leadership role — people are waiting for your direction.",reversed:"Impulsiveness, haste, ruthless, high expectations, lack of follow-through on grand visions."},
  // Cups
  {name:"Ace of Cups",symbol:"🏆",upright:"Love, new relationships, compassion, creativity, overwhelming emotion.
